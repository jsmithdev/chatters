## Notes

Tested on Account

Uses lookup fields (references) on the sobject of record (not childRelationships)

There will be ones you want to ignore. Account has a reference of CloneSourceId for instance. Made a util with ignore array for now

With childRelationships, there would likely be many more to ignore (Account has 64 in my dev org)
